The Proof of Stake (PoS) concept states that a person can earn rewards and validate block transactions according to how many tokens they have provided those tokens are locked for this purpose i.e staked. You participate in the effort for securing the network and you are rewarded as a result.
Can I restake rewards? Yes, we allow the rewards to be restaked to further compound your rewards. Essentially, this allows you to stake more than the delegation cap for as long as you re-stake your earnings, therefore compounding your gains.</description></item><item><title>VaaS FAQ</title><link>https://mr.staker.ltd/docs/help/vaas-faq/</link><pubDate>Tue, 06 Oct 2020 08:49:31 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mr.staker.ltd/docs/help/vaas-faq/</guid><description>What is VaaS? VaaS (Validator as a Service) is a platform designed to provide managed hosting services for Elrond validator nodes, whether these nodes are hosted as standalone nodes or part of a Staking Provider.
This service is aimed towards the people/entities (i.e various organisation forms) who would like to have their own Elrond node/nodes or run their own Staking Provider, but lack the technical expertise to run the necessary services.</description></item></channel></rss>
